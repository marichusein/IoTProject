# IoTProject
Design and development of IoT projects - my project // FIT@UNMO

This project was developed as part of a college course aimed at providing students with an understanding of fundamental concepts in IoT projects. The primary objective of the project was to establish a "smart house" or connected house utilizing easily accessible sensors. Through the integration of sensors and the executive side, a range of functionalities were achieved, including the ability to turn on and off lights, detect movement in the absence of occupants, identify fire hazards, and lock or open windows to any degree between 0 and 180.

Although the project's original scope was extensive, its maximum potential was reached due to the node's operational limitations, which function on 3V voltage. Nevertheless, the project's design is straightforward, enabling it to be easily upgraded. Additionally, due to other faculty commitments, a small web application was created for the control side. The aim would be to develop a mobile application that would be more suited to this purpose or, at the very least, a responsive web application.

## Summary of the project:

- 	Equipment: NodeMCU ESP8266, LED Diode, IR flame sensor, IR motion sensor, Servo Motor

- 	Control side: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- 	Executive side: C/C++ in ArduinoIDE with ESP Library (v 2.7.4.)

-	All connected to Firebase
